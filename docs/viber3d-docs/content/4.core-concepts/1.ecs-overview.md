title: ECS Overview
description: Viber3D uses an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture via the koota library.

## What is ECS?

ECS is a data-driven pattern where:
- **Entities** are unique identifiers that represent "things" in your game (players, enemies, bullets)
- **Traits** (components) hold pure data for those entities
- **Systems** process matching entities each frame to implement game logic

## Why ECS?

1. **Flexibility**  
   Entities can have any combination of traits, making it more flexible than traditional inheritance.

2. **Performance**  
   Data-oriented design enables efficient iteration and better cache utilization.

3. **Maintainability**  
   Clear separation of data (traits) from logic (systems) makes code easier to understand and modify.

4. **Composability**
   New features can be added by creating new traits and systems without modifying existing code.

## ECS in Viber3D

```ts
// Define a trait (component)
export const Position = trait({
  x: 0, y: 0, z: 0
})

// Create an entity with traits
world.spawn(Position, Health({ amount: 100 }))

// Query entities with specific traits
const movableEntities = useQuery([Position, Velocity]);

// Process entities in a system
function MovementSystem() {
  const entities = useQuery([Position, Velocity]);
  
  useFrame(() => {
    for (const entity of entities) {
      const position = entity.get(Position);
      const velocity = entity.get(Velocity);
      
      position.x += velocity.x;
      position.y += velocity.y;
      position.z += velocity.z;
    }
  });
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Adding Features to Entities

To add new features to game objects, create new traits instead of modifying existing ones:

```ts
// Adding health system
entity.set(Health, { current: 100, max: 100 });

// Adding weapon system
entity.set(Weapon, { damage: 10, fireRate: 0.5 });
```

### Querying Entities

```ts
// Find all entities with both Health and Transform
const entities = useQuery([Health, Transform]);

// Find first player entity
const player = useQueryFirst(IsPlayer);
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep traits simple**: Traits should only contain data, no logic
- **Write single-purpose systems**: Each system should focus on one aspect of game logic
- **Use queries efficiently**: Only query for the traits you need
- **Composition over inheritance**: Build complex entities by combining simple traits
- **Clean up resources**: Make sure to handle entity removal properly
