# Entity Component System (ECS) Overview

Viber3D uses an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture through the [koota](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koota) library. This pattern provides a flexible and efficient way to structure game logic.

## What is ECS?

ECS is a software architectural pattern that follows composition over inheritance and separates:

- **Entities**: The "things" in your game (players, enemies, bullets)
- **Traits** (Components): Data that defines entity properties
- **Systems**: Logic that processes entities with specific traits

## Why ECS?

ECS offers several advantages for game development:

1. **Flexibility**
   - Easy to add or remove behaviors
   - Entities can be composed of any combination of traits
   - Systems can be enabled/disabled dynamically

2. **Performance**
   - Data-oriented design
   - Efficient iteration over entities
   - Cache-friendly memory layout

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation of data and logic
   - Systems are focused and single-purpose
   - Easy to debug and test

## ECS in Viber3D

Here's a simple example of how ECS works in Viber3D:

```typescript
// Define a trait
const Position = trait({
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
  z: 0
});

// Create an entity with traits
world.spawn(
  Position,
  Health({ value: 100 })
);

// System that processes entities
function moveSystem(world: World) {
  world.query(Position).updateEach(([position]) => {
    // Update position logic here
  });
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Traits Simple**
   - Traits should only contain data
   - Avoid methods in traits
   - Use plain data types when possible

2. **System Design**
   - Each system should have a single responsibility
   - Systems should be pure functions
   - Order systems by dependency

3. **Entity Management**
   - Create entities through action functions
   - Clean up entities when no longer needed
   - Use queries efficiently
