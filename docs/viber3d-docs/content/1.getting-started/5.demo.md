## How to Use the Demo

1. **Navigate** to [viber3d-spacewars.kevinkern.dev](https://viber3d-spacewars.kevinkern.dev/)
2. **Explore** the 3D environment and interact with objects
3. **Test** different features and capabilities of the engine
4. **Observe** how various systems work together to create a cohesive experience

## Learning from the Demo

The demo serves as both a showcase and a learning tool. As you interact with it, consider:

- How different components interact with each other
- How the physics system handles collisions and movement
- How the rendering pipeline creates visual effects
- How user input is translated into in-game actions

## Source Code

Interested in how the demo was built? The complete source code is available in the Viber3D repository. You can use it as a reference for building your own games and applications with Viber3D.
