## Cursor AI Integration

To enhance your development experience with Cursor AI, add our LLMs documentation:

1. Visit [viber3d.instructa.ai/llms_full.txt](https://viber3d.instructa.ai/llms_full.txt)
2. Add this documentation URL to Cursor AI's documentation settings
3. Cursor AI will now provide intelligent assistance specific to Viber3D development when you add `@Docs` and then search for the docs like `viber3d`.

For detailed instructions on adding custom documentation to Cursor AI, visit our [tutorial](https://www.instructa.ai/en/blog/how-to-add-custom-documentation-in-cursor-ai).
