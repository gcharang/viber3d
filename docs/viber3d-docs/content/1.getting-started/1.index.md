Viber3D is built around several core concepts that make game development intuitive and efficient:

- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: A flexible, data-driven architecture for building game objects
- **Scene Management**: Easy-to-use scene system for organizing your game worlds
- **Asset Pipeline**: Efficient asset loading and management
- **Input System**: Comprehensive input handling for keyboard, mouse, and touch
- **Physics System**: Built-in physics engine for realistic interactions
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Modern WebGL-based rendering (via React Three Fiber) with optimization features
- **Audio System**: Spatial audio support for immersive game experiences
- **Networking**: Built-in networking capabilities for multiplayer games
- **Development Tools**: Debug tools and performance monitoring
