# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up your Viber3D project from scratch.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

The simplest way to get started is to clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/instructa/viber3d.git
```

If you received the code from another source or are using your own repository, adjust the URL accordingly.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd viber3d
npm install

- React and React DOM
- React Three Fiber
- Three.js
- Koota (ECS library)
- Tailwind CSS
- Development tools and TypeScript

### 3. Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify everything is set up correctly by:
1. Checking that all dependencies were installed successfully
2. Ensuring no major errors appear in the terminal
3. Looking for the `node_modules` directory in your project root
