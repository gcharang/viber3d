[**Cursor Rules**](https://www.instructa.ai/en/blog/how-to-use-cursor-rules-in-version-0-45) are a feature of [Cursor AI](https://cursor.com) that let you define project-specific guidelines for code generation. By storing these guidelines in `.mdc` (Markdown Cursor) files, you can ensure the AI consistently follows your coding styles, ECS patterns, and architecture rules—particularly useful in Viber3D or any ECS-based React project.

## Introduction

When building a 3D game or any application, it's crucial to maintain consistent styles and best practices. **Cursor Rules** provide a centralized way to instruct the AI about your project's needs:

- ECS architecture guidelines  
- React Three Fiber best practices  
- Trait naming conventions  
- System structure (pure functions, minimal side effects)  
- Directory layouts (e.g., `src/components`, `src/systems`, etc.)  

This is especially handy if multiple developers or AI instances are collaborating on the same codebase.

## What Are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules come in two varieties:

1. **Global Rules**: Applied to all projects on your machine via Cursor's global settings.  
2. **Project Rules**: Kept in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` within your project. These are more specific to your current codebase or framework (e.g. "Use ECS with Koota," "Use `useTraitEffect` for trait-based triggers," etc.).

**.mdc** stands for **Markdown Cursor**, indicating these rules are written as Markdown with some extra front matter for metadata (like `description:` and `globs:`).

### Example MDC File

```md
---
description: React Component Rules
globs: *.tsx
---

# React Component Guidelines
- Use functional components
- Implement ECS data flow with Koota (no direct game logic in components)
- Keep all game logic in systems, not `useFrame`
```

## Project Rules and .mdc Files

In your **Viber3D** game, you'll see a `.cursor/rules` directory containing `.mdc` files, for example:

```bash
.cursor/
└── rules/
    ├── base.mdc
    ├── components.mdc
    ├── systems.mdc
    ├── traits.mdc
    └── utils.mdc
```

Each file has:

- **Front matter**: fields like `description` and `globs`.  
- **Markdown content**: sets out the code style, architecture, or other guidelines.  

When Cursor AI processes your code, if your open file matches a `.mdc` rule's `globs` (e.g. `*.ts`, `src/components/**/*.tsx`), it automatically includes that rule's content into the conversation context. As a result, the AI's suggestions will better align with your instructions.

### Typical Fields

- **`description:`** Summarizes what the rule is about.  
- **`globs:`** Indicates which files or directories it applies to (`src/components/**/*.tsx`, `*.md`, etc.).  
- **`alwaysApply:`** (Optional) If set true, the rule is always used.  
- Then a Markdown body explaining your guidelines, best practices, do's/don'ts, or code examples.

## How They're Used in Viber3D

In a typical Viber3D project:

1. **ECS Systems** need certain constraints: pure functions, minimal side effects, delta-based movement, etc.  
2. **React Components** should avoid game logic (only visuals).  
3. **Traits** should remain small and data-focused.  
4. **Directory Structure** might follow the pattern `src/{components, systems, traits, utils}`.  

All these guidelines can go into `.mdc` files. For instance:

- **`base.mdc`** might state overarching ECS + R3F principles.  
- **`components.mdc`** can specify that "Components must not contain ECS logic" and "Use `useTraitEffect` only for visual triggers."  
- **`systems.mdc`** can define how you structure your system files (`export const functionName = (world: World) => { ... }`).  
- **`traits.mdc`** can detail how to define `trait({ ... })` objects for data.  
- **`utils.mdc`** might outline your best practices for math or utility modules.

During development, whenever you open or modify a file that matches the rule's glob pattern, Cursor AI automatically includes those rules. As you ask for code suggestions or expansions, the AI will do so in alignment with your `.mdc` definitions.

## Creating or Editing Cursor Rules

1. **Open the Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and choose "New Cursor Rule."  
2. **Name your file** and specify the `globs`.  
3. **Write** the guidelines in the Markdown body. Provide bullet points, code samples, or detailed instructions.  
4. **Commit** it to version control so your team shares the same rules.  

You can also edit existing `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules` at any time.

## Benefits of Cursor Rules

1. **Consistency**: The AI's code suggestions remain consistent with your ECS architecture, naming conventions, or React style.  
2. **Productivity**: Faster code generation that needs fewer manual fixes.  
3. **Team Alignment**: Everyone on the project sees the same `.mdc` rules, ensuring uniform coding standards.  
4. **Reduced Errors**: By embedding best practices (e.g. "do not mix ECS logic in React components"), you reduce logic bugs.  

## Example Use Cases

- **Framework-Specific**: Mandating SolidJS or React patterns for `*.tsx`.  
- **Auto-Generated Files**: Telling Cursor not to modify `.proto` or `.glb` files.  
- **Folder-Specific**: For `src/systems/**/*.ts`, always mention a "pure system, no side effects" approach.  
- **UI Patterns**: Ensuring usage of Tailwind classes for styling, or restricting inline styles.

## Best Practices

- Keep rules **clear** and **concise**.  
- Provide **code examples** in the markdown.  
- Use **`globs`** to apply the rule only where relevant.  
- Keep them up to date as your team's conventions evolve.  

## Conclusion

Cursor Rules—and the `.mdc` files that store them—offer a powerful way to guide the Cursor AI so it consistently follows your Viber3D game's coding patterns. Whether you're enforcing ECS best practices, React Three Fiber do's and don'ts, or file-based architecture rules, well-crafted `.mdc` rules can greatly improve your development flow.
