# Production Build

Learn how to create and test production builds of your Viber3D game.

## Creating a Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will:
- Compile your TypeScript code
- Bundle all assets
- Optimize for production
- Generate static files in the `dist/` directory

## Testing the Production Build

To preview your production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve your built files at `http://localhost:4173` by default.

## What Gets Optimized

The production build process includes several optimizations:

- **Code Minification**
  - JavaScript and CSS minification
  - Dead code elimination
  - Tree shaking for unused code

- **Asset Optimization**
  - Image compression
  - Font subsetting
  - Static asset fingerprinting

- **Performance Improvements**
  - Code splitting
  - Lazy loading of components
  - Caching headers setup

## Deployment Ready

After building:
- The `dist/` folder contains all necessary files
- These files can be deployed to any static hosting service
- No server-side runtime is required

## Build Configuration

You can customize the build process through:
- Vite configuration
- Environment variables
- TypeScript compiler options
