## Creating a Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will:
- Compile your TypeScript code
- Bundle all assets
- Optimize for production
- Output static files in `dist/`

## Testing the Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

This serves your built files at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) by default.

## Optimizations

- **Code Minification**  
  JavaScript & CSS minified, dead code elimination, tree-shaking.

- **Asset Optimization**  
  Image compression, font subsetting, static asset fingerprinting.

- **Performance**  
  Code splitting, lazy loading components, caching headers.

## Deployment

After building:
- The `dist/` folder contains everything needed
- Deploy to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- No server runtime required
