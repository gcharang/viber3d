# Credits & Acknowledgments

Viber3D was created by [Kevin Kern](https://x.com/kregenrek) and is a project by [Instructa.ai](https://www.instructa.ai/).

Viber3D stands on the shoulders of giants. This project wouldn't be possible without the contributions of many talented individuals and the amazing open-source libraries they've created.

## Special Thanks

### Koota ECS

This kit is heavily inspired by and uses a lot of concepts from [Koota](https://github.com/krispya/koota), an elegant Entity Component System for JavaScript and TypeScript. Koota provides the foundation for our game architecture, enabling flexible and performant game development.

Special thanks and credits to:

- **[Krispya](https://github.com/krispya)** - Creator of Koota
- **[Brian](https://github.com/Ctrlmonster)** - Contributor and supporter

### Three.js

At the core of our 3D rendering capabilities is [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a powerful JavaScript 3D library that makes WebGL accessible and intuitive. We're deeply grateful to:

- **[Ricardo Cabello (Mr.doob)](https://github.com/mrdoob)** - Creator and maintainer of Three.js
- **The Three.js core team** - For their ongoing development and maintenance
- **The Three.js community** - For their extensive examples, documentation, and support

Three.js has revolutionized 3D on the web and made projects like Viber3D possible.

### React Three Fiber

Viber3D leverages the power of [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), a React renderer for Three.js. We're grateful to the entire Poimandres collective for their incredible work on:

- React Three Fiber
- Drei
- Zustand
- and other related libraries

### Nuxt & UnJS

Our documentation system and tooling are built on the excellent work of:

- **[The Nuxt Team](https://nuxt.com/)** - For their innovative approach to web development and the Nuxt Content module that powers our documentation
- **[The UnJS Team](https://unjs.io/)** - For their ecosystem of high-quality JavaScript tools that enable modern development workflows

Key UnJS libraries we use include:
- **Nitro** - For server functionality
- **Unimport** - For auto-imports
- **Unbuild** - For building packages
- **and many more** - The entire UnJS ecosystem has been invaluable

## Additional Libraries

Viber3D also benefits from many other open-source projects, including:

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and developer experience
- **Vite** - For fast, modern development tooling
- **TailwindCSS** - For utility-first styling

## Community

Finally, we'd like to thank the growing community of Viber3D users and contributors who provide feedback, report issues, and help improve the project.
