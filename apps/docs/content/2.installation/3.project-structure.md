# Project Structure

Understanding the project structure is crucial for effectively working with Viber3D. Here's a detailed overview of the key directories and files in your project.

## Directory Structure

```
viber3d/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/         # Additional coding rule files (optional)
├── src/
│   ├── components/    # React components for rendering 3D objects/UI
│   ├── systems/       # ECS Systems for game logic updates
│   ├── traits/        # ECS Traits (components) describing entity data
│   ├── utils/         # Utility functions (math, sorting, spatial hashing)
│   ├── actions.ts     # Central actions to spawn or modify entities
│   ├── Game.tsx       # Main React component with Canvas
│   ├── gameloop.ts    # Entry point for the main ECS update loop
│   ├── main.tsx       # React app root
│   ├── startup.tsx    # Startup logic (initial spawns, intervals)
│   └── world.ts       # Creates the ECS world with default traits
├── index.html         # Basic HTML page with root div
└── package.json       # Project dependencies and scripts
```

## Key Directories Explained

### `/src/components`
- React components for rendering 3D objects and UI elements
- Includes both Three.js objects and regular React components
- Organized by feature or object type

### `/src/systems`
- Contains ECS system files
- Each system is responsible for specific game logic
- Systems run every frame or on specific events

### `/src/traits`
- Defines ECS traits (components)
- Each trait represents a specific aspect of an entity
- Contains data structures and initial values

### `/src/utils`
- Helper functions and utilities
- Math operations
- Common game-related algorithms

## Key Files

### `actions.ts`
- Central place for entity manipulation
- Contains functions to spawn and modify entities
- Helps maintain consistent entity creation

### `Game.tsx`
- Main game component
- Sets up the Three.js canvas
- Configures the game environment

### `gameloop.ts`
- Manages the main game loop
- Orchestrates system execution
- Handles timing and updates

### `world.ts`
- Creates and configures the ECS world
- Defines default traits
- Sets up initial world state

## Customization

Feel free to modify this structure to better suit your needs:
- Add new directories for specific features
- Reorganize components based on your game's architecture
- Create additional utility folders as needed
